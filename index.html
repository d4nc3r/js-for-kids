      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language used in web browsers, like Chrome
        and Firefox. It's a way to provide the browser with some instructions
        to follow - like changing the color of a button every time we click
        it. Almost every website uses at least a little bit of JavaScript, and
        all of the "blocks" you used in yesterday's exercises used JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>Try clicking the button, and see what happens.</p>
      <button id="colors">click me!</button>
      <p>
        Now right-click on the button and choose "inspect" - and notice how we
        can see the HTML code for our button now. Try clicking the button
        again. Pay attention to how the background-color style in the HTML
        changes - that's JavaScript doing that! Let's learn a little bit about how JavaScript works so we can write
        our own code. (for later - check out some <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp"
          target="_blank">HTML color names</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't need any special tools to try writing JavaScript code because
        it runs right in our browser! Look for the "Console" tab in your
        Developer Tools. If you accidentally closed the Dev Tools, hit <code>F12</code> or
        right-click anywhere on the web page and choose "Inspect" again.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can type our JavaScript in this console, and any time we hit the
        <code>enter</code> key the browser will run it for us! Try typing a
        math equation, like <code>3 + 5</code> and hitting enter to see the
        answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can write equations with text (called <code>strings</code> in JavaScript) too. Any time we want to use a
        <code>string</code>, we need to use either single <code>'</code> or double <code>"</code>
        quotes around the text, so javascript knows how to read it. Try typing a <code>string</code> of text into the
        console, and hit enter. If you forget to put the quotes around your string, JavaScript with display an error -
        try that out so you can see what it looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can even add strings together - try typing <code>'hello' + ' ' + 'world!'</code> in the console and hit
        enter.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="vars">
      <h2>Variables & Equations</h2>
      <p>
        We can also store the answer to an equation in a <code>variable</code> so we can use it again
        later. To do that, we just add <code>let</code> at the beginning, give
        JavaScript a name for our variable, and set it equal to our equestion using an <code>=</code> sign:
      <pre>let answer = 3 + 5;</pre>

      You may notice that you don't see the answer when you hit enter this time - that's because JavaScript put the
      answer inside our <code>variable</code> - to see the result we just need to type our variable name "answer", and
      hit
      <code>enter</code>!
      </p>
      <p>We can store other kinds of values in <code>variables</code>, not just numbers. This time let's try storing
        some text.
        Create a variable called "greeting", set it equal to some text:

      <pre>let greeting = "hello world!";</pre>

      Now let's say we want to combine some text with a variable, maybe we want to store a person's name and then use
      their name in our greeting. There's a special kind of quote called a <code>backtick</code> we can use to do that.
      When we put backticks <code>`</code> around our text, we can include our variables inside by using
      <code>$</code> and putting our variable inside of some curly braces. Let's create a new variable called
      <code>name</code>, and use that inside of a larger <code>string</code> called <code>hello</code>:
      <pre>let name = "jamie";
let hello = `hi, ${name}`;</pre>

      Now when we type "hello" and hit enter - you should see "hi" and the value in your "name" variable!
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="log-alert">
      <h2>Console.log and Alert</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript has lots of built-in functionality. Right now, we're just going to look at a couple of functions that
        are really
        helpful for learning. First, let's try using <code>alert</code> to pop up a little message for us:
      <pre>alert("hello!");</pre>
      Whatever you put between the parenthases <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> will be displayed in the pop up! You
      can even put a variable in between the parenthases, rather than putting your literal string or number. For
      example, remember we had our <code>greeting</code> variable from earlier? We can use that inside of the alert:
      <pre>alert(greeting);</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we want to print or <code>log</code> some information or a variable without popping up a new windows.
        In these cases, we can use <code>console.log()</code>. Just like with <code>alert</code>, the value in between
        the parenthases is what will be logged - but this time instead of in the little pop up window, our value will be
        printed out to the console screen. For example:
      <pre>console.log(greeting);</pre>
      This is especially helpful when we want to see what our variable values are while our code is running.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="array">
      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we know how to create variables and how to log to the console, let's try something a little harder.
        Sometimes we need a list of values, and in JavaScript we call that an <code>array</code>. We can create an array
        by putting square brackets, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, around all the values we want in our list, and
        commas in between the values.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let's create an array of animals (you can pick your favorites):
      <pre>let animals = ["dog", "cat", "capybara"];</pre>

      Now if we type our variable name "animals" in the console and hit enter - we see our list of values. Try clicking
      the little arrow on the left-hand side, it will open up our <code>array</code> and show each value on its own
      line, as well as how many items are in the list.
      </p>
      <h3>Indexes</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript numbers every value in our array with an <code>index</code> so that we can get individual values from
        it. To get a single value out of our array, we type our variable name again, but this time we add square
        brackets with the index of the value we want in between them. If you look back at the array in your console
        (opened up so each item is on its own line), you should see numbers to the left of each value - those are the
        indexes!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's try getting the value of our first animal out of our array:
      <pre>animals[0];</pre>

      It may look strange to use <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code> to get the first item in our
      list, but JavaScript always starts counting at zero, so our first item is index zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try practicing by asking JavaScript to display the 2nd or 3rd item in your list.
        <!-- <pre>animals[2];</pre> -->
      </p>
      <h3>Length</h3>
      <p>
        If you need to know how many items are in an array, you can ask JavaScript the <code>length</code>, like this:
      <pre>animals.length;</pre>
      </p>
      <h3>Updating</h3>
      <p>
        Adding new values into our array is easy, we can use <code>push</code> to "push" a new value onto the end of our
        animals array:
      <pre>animals.push("giraffe");</pre>
      Check the console again to see what your array looks like now!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's say we want to remove the last item in our array - we can <code>pop</code> that value right off the
        end
        and store it in a variable, like this:
      <pre>let last = animals.pop();</pre>
      Check the value of <code>animals</code> again, and now it has only 3 items again - <code>giraffe</code> is gone,
      but you can now find it in the variable called <code>last</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also change a value in our array if we need to. Let's use what we know already to change the value of
        "cat" to be "kitten".
        <!-- <pre>animals[1] = "kitten";</pre> -->
        After you run your code, try testing it by displaying <code>animals</code> one more time - you should no longer
        see cat, instead you'll see kitten :)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="objects">
      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        When we want to group some information together, we can use an <code>object</code> in JavaScript. For example,
        we may want data that represents a person. It might have a <code>name</code>, an <code>age</code>, and a
        <code>favoriteColor</code>:
      <pre>
let person = {
  name: "Moana",
  age: "16",
  favoriteColor: "ocean blue"
}</pre>
      Try copying and pasting the code into your Dev Tools console, hit enter, and type "person" to ask JavaScript to
      display our person object.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks a little bit like our array doesn't it, except with curly brackets instead of square ones. Try clicking
        the arrow on the left-hand side to open up the object. Just like with our array, it shows us each value on a
        separate line, but this time instead of an <code>index</code> we see our <code>key</code> on the left of our
        values.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we can get a single value out of our array by saying <code>arrayName[index]</code>, try to guess how you
        could get a single value from our object. (<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showAnswer(1)">show
          answer</a>)
      </p>
      <div id="answer-1" class="hidden">
        <p>
          We can use the <code>key</code> next to the value you want inside square brackets to get a
          single
          value:
        <pre>person["favoriteColor"];</pre>
        There's also a special way to get values from an object called <code>dot notation</code>, a fancy way of saying
        add a <code>dot</code> and then the <code>key</code> for the value you want:
        <pre>person.name;</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now try writing our greeting from earlier, but use our person's name inside it. Remember, when we want to use
          a
          variable inside of our text, use the special backticks <code>`</code> instead of quotes, and put
          <code>${}</code> around the variable we want to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be tempting to put <code>person</code> inside the curly brackets - just to see what would happen, try
          using our <code>person</code> object inside our string of text, we can try it out using `console.log`:
        <pre>console.log(`hi, ${person}`};</pre>
        That looks super weird, doesn't it? That's because an object isn't just one
        value, like <code>person.name</code> or <code>person.age</code> is, it's a group of values, so when JavaScript
        tries to put the whole thing into a string, it will just show us that it's an object by printing
        <code>[object Object]</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We just want to say "hi" to our
          person's name - so we can either use square brackets like this:
        <pre>let greeting = `hi, ${person["name"]}`;</pre>
        or we can use <code>dot notation</code> instead, like this:
        <pre>let greeting = `hi, ${person.name}`;</pre>
        </p>

      </div>

    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="ifelse">
      <h2>Conditionals - If / Else</h2>
      <p>
        When we want the computer to perform a task *sometimes*, under certain conditions, that's called a
        <code>conditional</code>,
        or an "if/else" statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start with an object to represent a pet:
      <pre>let pet = {
  name: "Fido",
  age: 2,
  type: "dog"
};</pre>

      Now let's write a <code>conditional</code> statement to pop up an alert message that says "good dog!" if our pet
      is a dog:
      <pre>if (pet.type === "dog") {
  alert("good dog!");
}</pre>
      Now what if our pet was actually a cat? Try changing your pet's <code>type</code> to be "cat", and run your
      <code>if statement</code> again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing happened! Does that mean our code is broken? Nope! Our <code>if statement</code> is checking to see if
        our pet's <code>type</code> is "dog", and it only pops up our alert if it is. Now that our pet's type is "cat",
        it no longer satisfies the <code>condition</code> of our statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we want to say something <code>else</code> when our pet is not a dog, we can add to our
        <code>conditional</code>:
      <pre>if (pet.type === "dog") {
  alert("good dog!");
} else {
  alert("here kitty!");
}</pre>
      Now try running your <code>if/else</code> statement when your pet's type is "cat" and again when its type is "dog"
      and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly - if you only want to pop an alert message if your pet is a cat or a dog, but do nothing if it's a
        different type of pet, you can add an <code>else if</code> instead of an <code>else</code>, like this:
      <pre>if (pet.type === "dog") {
  alert("good dog!");
} else if (pet.type === "cat") {
  alert("here kitty!");
}</pre>
      Now if you set your pet's type to "turtle", you won't see an alert pop up at all!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="functions">
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are like blocks, they group instructions together so we can run it more than once, sometimes with
        different values passed in to change the behavior of our function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some functions just <i>DO</i> something, for example - we can write a function to "sayHi", like this:
      <pre>function sayHi() {
  console.log("hello world!");
}</pre>
      Now if we type "sayHi" and hit enter, javascript shows us exactly what instructions our function will run. If we
      want javascript to actually run them, we have to type sayHi() with the parenthases, this tells javascript to
      actually run our instructions for us, and we can do that as many times as we want.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can write a more useful function by sending some data, called a <code>parameter</code>, into our function to
        be used by our instructions. Let's re-write our sayHi function, this time passing it a name:
      <pre>function sayHi(name) {
  console.log(`hi, ${name}!`);
}</pre>
      Now we can <code>call</code> the function with any name we want inside the parenthases, and javascript will print
      out hi, and
      the name (try a few).
      </p>
      <p>
        If we forget to put some text inside the parenthases, javascript prints out hi, undefined - and what
        <code>undefined</code>
        means it that javascript doesn't know the value of "name", because we forgot to give it a value. Any time you
        see <code>undefined</code> in the console, it probably means javascript was looking for a variable that doesn't
        have a value yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's try a function that <code>returns</code> something. How about a function that takes two numbers,
        multiplies them, and returns the answer? It's almost like the functions we've written before, but this time we
        had a <code>return statement</code>.
      <pre>function times(num1, num2) {
  return num1 * num2;
}</pre>
      Now you can call <code>times</code> with any 2 numbers you like, and it will return the value of the first number
      times the second number. This also means you can set a new variable equal to the return value of our function if
      we'd like to store the answer, like this:
      <pre>let answer = times(7, 15);</pre>
      This time when we run the code it doesn't display the answer - because it was saved in our <code>answer</code>
      variable. Try displaying our answer variable in the console - and you should see what 7 times 15 is!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="all-together">
      <h2>Putting it all Together</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we have learned a little bit about the lanaguage of JavaScript, let's put it all together!
      </p>
      <p>
        We've seen that we can create a an object to represent a pet, but what if we had a lot of pets? We could create
        an array - it could look like this:
      <pre>let pets = [
  { name: "Fido", age: 2, type: "dog"},
  { name: "Snowball", age: 5, type: "cat"},
  { name: "Spot", age: 7, type: "dog"},
  { name: "Goldie", age: 1, type: "fish"}
];</pre>
      Each item in our array is a pet object!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that our code is getting a little more complex - it will be easier to use an
        online tool to write our code. Open this <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play?id=cpqMXRcTfYUg8Orx%2FGHE2FV9jbH6%2BWU7JQbL5wwX9mvfYve3Z4rjOFqkY1oogRVZ0%2BRAyyg5oBsBWipN"
          target="_blank">JavaScript playground</a>, it already has our pets array defined!
      </p>
      <p>
        We're going to use this array to practice everything we've learned so far!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Count the number of dogs in our pets array using a <code>for loop</code></li>
        <li>Loop thru our pets and say "hi" to each one by name using <code>forEach</code></li>
        <li>Write a <code>function</code> that takes the type of pet as a parameter and counts how many of that type of
          pet we have
        </li>
        <li>BONUS! Use <code>filter</code> on our pets array to simplify our function</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="loops">
      <h2>Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes we want to loop through some data or repeat our instructions more than once. There's a few different
        ways to do that in JavaScript, we're going to focus on the <code>for loop</code> and on the <code>forEach</code>
        function.
      </p>
      <h3>For Loop</h3>
      <p>
        We use a <code>for</code> loop any time we want to repeat instructions a certain number of times. First we set
        up how many times we'd like to repeat our code:
      <pre>
for(let count = 0; count < 5; count++) {

}</pre>
      This will create a variable called "count" just for our for loop and set it equal to zero to start. JavaScript
      will
      continue to loop as long as <code>count</code> is less than 5, and it will add 1 to <code>count</code> every time
      the code runs (that is what <code>count++</code> does).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, we need to add some code in between the curly brackets - whatever we put there will run over and over,
        until <code>count</code> is no longer less than 5. For example, this will print out the value of
        <code>count</code> each time the loop runs.
      <pre>
for(let count = 0; count < 5; count++) {
  console.log(count);
}</pre>
      We could also use a for loop to print out all of our values in an array. Let's try creating a new array, with
      whatever values you'd like in it, for example:
      <pre>
let foods = ["pizza", "cheeseburgers", "skittles"];</pre>
      Now we'll create a for loop that will start with zero, and loop as long as the index is less than the length of
      the array:
      <pre>
for(let index = 0; index < foods.length; index++) {
  console.log(foods[index]);
}</pre>
      </p>
      <h3>ForEach Loop</h3>
      <p>
        When we want to loop through all the values in an array, there's an easier way to do that than the for loop!
        Arrays have a special function called <code>forEach</code> that lets us loop through each value once:
      <pre>
foods.forEach(food => {
  console.log(food);
})</pre>
      </p>
