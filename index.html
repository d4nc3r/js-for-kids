      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language used in web browsers, like Chrome
        and Firefox. It's a way to provide the browser with some instructions
        to follow - like changing the color of a button every time we click
        it. Almost every website uses at least a little bit of JavaScript, and
        all of the "blocks" you used in yesterday's exercises used JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>Try clicking the button, and see what happens.</p>
      <button id="colors">click me!</button>
      <p>
        Now right-click on the button and choose "inspect" - and notice how we
        can see the HTML code for our button now. Try clicking the button
        again. Pay attention to how the background-color style in the HTML
        changes - that's JavaScript doing that!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's learn a little bit about how JavaScript works so we can write
        our own code.
      </p>

      <h2>Variables & Equations</h2>
      <p>
        We don't need any special tools to try writing JavaScript code because
        it runs right in our browser! Look for the "Console" tab in your
        Developer Tools. If you accidentally closed the Dev Tools, hit <code>F12</code> or
        right-click anywhere on the web page and choose "Inspect" again.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can type our JavaScript in this console, and any time we hit the
        <code>enter</code> key the browser will run it for us! Try typing a
        math equation, like <code>3 + 5</code> and hitting enter to see the
        answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also store the answer to our equation in a <code>variable</code> so we can use it again
        later. To do that, we just add <code>let</code> at the beginning and give
        JavaScript a name for where we want to store the answer to our math
        equation:
      <pre>
          let answer = 3 + 5;
        </pre>

      You may notice that you don't see the answer when you hit enter this time - that's because JavaScript put the
      answer inside our <code>variable</code> - to see the answer we just need to type "answer" and hit
      <code>enter</code>!
      </p>
      <p>We can store other kinds of values in <code>variables</code>, not just numbers. This time let's try storing
        some text.
        Any time we want to use text, called
        <code>strings</code> in JavaScript, we need to use either single <code>'</code> or double <code>"</code> quotes
        around the text, so javascript knows how
        to read it. Create a variable called "greeting", set it equal to some text, and use <code>alert</code> to pop up
        your new greeting:

      <pre>
          let greeting = "hello world!";

          alert(greeting);
        </pre>
      When we want to combine some text with a variable, there's a special kind of quote called a back-tick
      <code>`</code> we can use. Let's create a new variable called <code>name</code>, and use that inside of a larger
      <code>string</code>:
      <pre>
        let name = "jamie";
        let hello = `hi, ${name}`;

        alert(hello);
      </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        To make it a little easier to see what we are doing, we will use an
        online tool called JSFiddle to learn some of our basics.
