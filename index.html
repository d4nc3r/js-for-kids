      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language used in web browsers, like Chrome
        and Firefox. It's a way to provide the browser with some instructions
        to follow - like changing the color of a button every time we click
        it. Almost every website uses at least a little bit of JavaScript, and
        all of the "blocks" you used in yesterday's exercises used JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>Try clicking the button, and see what happens.</p>
      <button id="colors">click me!</button>
      <p>
        Now right-click on the button and choose "inspect" - and notice how we
        can see the HTML code for our button now. Try clicking the button
        again. Pay attention to how the background-color style in the HTML
        changes - that's JavaScript doing that!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's learn a little bit about how JavaScript works so we can write
        our own code.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="vars">
      <h2>Variables & Equations</h2>
      <p>
        We don't need any special tools to try writing JavaScript code because
        it runs right in our browser! Look for the "Console" tab in your
        Developer Tools. If you accidentally closed the Dev Tools, hit <code>F12</code> or
        right-click anywhere on the web page and choose "Inspect" again.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can type our JavaScript in this console, and any time we hit the
        <code>enter</code> key the browser will run it for us! Try typing a
        math equation, like <code>3 + 5</code> and hitting enter to see the
        answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also store the answer to our equation in a <code>variable</code> so we can use it again
        later. To do that, we just add <code>let</code> at the beginning and give
        JavaScript a name for where we want to store the answer to our math
        equation:
      <pre>let answer = 3 + 5;</pre>

      You may notice that you don't see the answer when you hit enter this time - that's because JavaScript put the
      answer inside our <code>variable</code> - to see the answer we just need to type "answer" and hit
      <code>enter</code>!
      </p>
      <p>We can store other kinds of values in <code>variables</code>, not just numbers. This time let's try storing
        some text.
        Any time we want to use text, called
        <code>strings</code> in JavaScript, we need to use either single <code>'</code> or double <code>"</code> quotes
        around the text, so javascript knows how
        to read it. Create a variable called "greeting", set it equal to some text, and then use the <code>alert</code>
        function to pop up
        your new greeting:

      <pre>let greeting = "hello world!";

alert(greeting);</pre>

      Now let's say we want to combine some text with a variable, maybe we want to store a person's name and then use
      their name in our greeting. There's a special kind of quote called a <code>backtick</code> we can use to do that.
      When we put backticks <code>`</code> around our text, we can include our variables inside as well by using
      <code>$</code> and putting our variable inside of some curly braces. Let's create a new variable called
      <code>name</code>, and use that inside of a larger <code>string</code> called <code>hello</code>:
      <pre>
let name = "jamie";
let hello = `hi, ${name}`;

alert(hello);</pre>

      Now when we type "hello" and hit enter - you should see "hi" and the value in your "name" variable!
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="objects">
      <h2>Objects</h2>
      <p>
        When we want to group some information together, we can use an <code>object</code> in JavaScript. For example,
        we may want a person to have a <code>name</code>, an <code>age</code>, and a <code>favoriteColor</code>:
      <pre>
let person = {
  name: "Moana",
  age: "16",
  favoriteColor: "ocean blue"
}</pre>
      Try copying and pasting the code into your Dev Tools console, hit enter, and type "person" to ask JavaScript to
      display our person object.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks a little bit like our array doesn't it, except with curly brackets instead of square ones. Try clicking
        the arrow on the left-hand side to open up the object. Just like with our array, it shows us each value on a
        separate line, but this time instead of an <code>index</code> we see our <code>key</code> on the left of our
        values.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we can get a single value out of our array by saying <code>arrayName[index]</code>, try to guess how you
        could get a single value from our object.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        That's right! We can use the <code>key</code> next to the value you want inside square brackets to get a single
        value:
      <pre>
person["favoriteColor"];</pre>
      There's also a special way to get values from an object called <code>dot notation</code>, a fancy way of saying
      add a <code>dot</code> and then the <code>key</code> for the value you want:
      <pre>
person.name;</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now try writing our greeting from earlier, but use our person's name inside it. Remember, when we want to use a
        variable inside of our text, use the special backticks <code>`</code> instead of quotes, and put
        <code>${}</code> around the variable we want to use.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        It might be tempting to put <code>person</code> inside the curly brackets, but we just want to say "hi" to our
        person's name - so we can either use square brackets like this:
      <pre>
let greeting = `hi, ${person["name"]}`;</pre>
      or we can use <code>dot notation</code> instead, like this:
      <pre>
let greeting = `hi, ${person.name}`;</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to see what would happen, try using our <code>person</code> object inside our string of text, and then ask
        JavaScript for the value:
      <pre>
let greeting = `hi, ${person}`;</pre>
      That looks super weird, doesn't it? That's because an object isn't just one string
      value, like <code>person.name</code> or <code>person.age</code> is, it's a group of values, so when JavaScript
      tries to put the whole thing into a string, it will just show us that it's an object by printing
      <code>[object Object]</code>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="array">
      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we know how to create a string variable, let's try something a little harder. Sometimes in JavaScript
        we need a list of values, and we call that an <code>array</code>. In JavaScript we can create an array by
        putting square brackets, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, around all the values we want in our list, and
        commas in between the values.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let's create an array of your favorite animals:
      <pre>
let animals = ["dog", "cat", "capybara"];</pre>
      Now if we type our variable name "animals" in the console and hit enter - we see our list of values. Try clicking
      the little arrow on the left-hand side, it will open up our <code>array</code> and show each value on its own
      line, as well as how many items are in the list. You will also see that there is a number in front of each of our
      values now, that number is called the <code>index</code>. JavaScript assigns every value in our array an index so
      that we can get individual values back out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get a single value out of our array, we type our variable name again, but this time we add square brackets
        with the index of the value we want in between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's try getting the first animal out of our array:
      <pre>
animals[0];
</pre>
      It may look strange to use <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code> to get the first item in our
      list, but JavaScript always starts counting at zero, so our first item is index zero - try displaying your array
      again and take a close look at
      what index number is next to each value in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try practicing by asking JavaScript to display the 3rd item in your list.
      </p>
      <p>
        array.length? push? pop?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="loops">
      <h2>Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes we want to loop through some data or repeat our instructions more than once. We will go
        over a couple of ways to loop in JavaScript, and to make it a little easier to see what we are doing we'll
        use an online tool called JSFiddle to learn some more of our basics.
        <a href="http://jsfiddle.net" target="_blank">Go to JSFiddle</a>
      </p>
      <h3>For Loop</h3>
      <p>
        We use a <code>for</code> loop any time we want to repeat instructions a certain number of times. First we set
        up how many times we'd like to repeat our code:
      <pre>
for(let count = 0; count < 5; count++) {

}</pre>
      This will create a variable called "count" just for our for loop and set it equal to zero to start. JavaScript
      will
      continue to loop as long as <code>count</code> is less than 5, and it will add 1 to <code>count</code> every time
      the code runs (that is what <code>count++</code> does).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, we need to add some code in between the curly brackets - whatever we put there will run over and over,
        until <code>count</code> is no longer less than 5. For example, this will print out the value of
        <code>count</code> each time the loop runs.
      <pre>
for(let count = 0; count < 5; count++) {
  console.log(count);
}</pre>
      We could also use a for loop to print out all of our values in an array. Let's try creating a new array, with
      whatever values you'd like in it, for example:
      <pre>
let foods = ["pizza", "cheeseburgers", "skittles"];</pre>
      Now we'll create a for loop that will start with zero, and loop as long as the index is less than the length of
      the array:
      <pre>
for(let index = 0; index < foods.length; index++) {
  console.log(foods[index]);
}</pre>
      </p>
      <h3>ForEach Loop</h3>
      <p>
        When we want to loop through all the values in an array, there's an easier way to do that than the for loop!
        Arrays have a special function called <code>forEach</code> that lets us loop through each value once:
      <pre>
foods.forEach(food => {
  console.log(food);
})</pre>
      </p>
