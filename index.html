      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language used in web browsers, like Chrome
        and Firefox. It's a way to provide the browser with some instructions
        to follow - like changing the color of a button every time we click
        it. Almost every website uses at least a little bit of JavaScript, and
        all of the "blocks" you used in yesterday's exercises used JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>Try clicking the button, and see what happens.</p>
      <button id="colors">click me!</button>
      <p>
        Now right-click on the button and choose "inspect" - and notice how we
        can see the HTML code for our button now. Try clicking the button
        again. Pay attention to how the background-color style in the HTML
        changes - that's JavaScript doing that!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's learn a little bit about how JavaScript works so we can write
        our own code.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="vars">
      <h2>Variables & Equations</h2>
      <p>
        We don't need any special tools to try writing JavaScript code because
        it runs right in our browser! Look for the "Console" tab in your
        Developer Tools. If you accidentally closed the Dev Tools, hit <code>F12</code> or
        right-click anywhere on the web page and choose "Inspect" again.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can type our JavaScript in this console, and any time we hit the
        <code>enter</code> key the browser will run it for us! Try typing a
        math equation, like <code>3 + 5</code> and hitting enter to see the
        answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also store the answer to our equation in a <code>variable</code> so we can use it again
        later. To do that, we just add <code>let</code> at the beginning and give
        JavaScript a name for where we want to store the answer to our math
        equation:
      <pre>let answer = 3 + 5;</pre>

      You may notice that you don't see the answer when you hit enter this time - that's because JavaScript put the
      answer inside our <code>variable</code> - to see the answer we just need to type "answer" and hit
      <code>enter</code>!
      </p>
      <p>We can store other kinds of values in <code>variables</code>, not just numbers. This time let's try storing
        some text.
        Any time we want to use text, called
        <code>strings</code> in JavaScript, we need to use either single <code>'</code> or double <code>"</code> quotes
        around the text, so javascript knows how
        to read it. Create a variable called "greeting", set it equal to some text, and then use the <code>alert</code>
        function to pop up
        your new greeting:

      <pre>let greeting = "hello world!";

alert(greeting);</pre>

      Now let's say we want to combine some text with a variable, maybe we want to store a person's name and then use
      their name in our greeting. There's a special kind of quote called a <code>backtick</code> we can use to do that.
      When we put backticks <code>`</code> around our text, we can include our variables inside as well by using
      <code>$</code> and putting our variable inside of some curly braces. Let's create a new variable called
      <code>name</code>, and use that inside of a larger <code>string</code> called <code>hello</code>:
      <pre>
let name = "jamie";
let hello = `hi, ${name}`;

alert(hello);</pre>

      Now when we type "hello" and hit enter - you should see "hi" and the value in your "name" variable!
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="array">
      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we know how to create a string variable, let's try something a little harder. Sometimes in JavaScript
        we need a list of values, and we call that an <code>array</code>. In JavaScript we can create an array by
        putting square brackets, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, around all the values we want in our list, and
        commas in between the values.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let's create an array of your favorite animals:
      <pre>
let animals = ["dog", "cat", "capybara"];</pre>
      Now if we type our variable name "animals" in the console and hit enter - we see our list of values. Try clicking
      the little arrow on the left-hand side, it will open up our <code>array</code> and show each value on its own
      line, as well as how many items are in the list. You will also see that there is a number in front of each of our
      values now, that number is called the <code>index</code>. JavaScript assigns every value in our array an index so
      that we can get individual values back out again.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get a single value out of our array, we type our variable name again, but this time we add square brackets
        with the index of the value we want in between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's try getting the first animal out of our array:
      <pre>
animals[0];
</pre>
      It may look strange to use <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code> to get the first item in our
      list, but JavaScript always starts counting at zero, so our first item is index zero - try displaying your array again and take a close look at
      what index number is next to each value in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try practicing by asking JavaScript to display the 3rd item in your list.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make it a little easier to see what we are doing, we will use an
        online tool called JSFiddle to learn some more of our basics.
